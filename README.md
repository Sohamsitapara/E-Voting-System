# 🗳️ E-Voting System

A secure, privacy-preserving remote voting system built with Node.js and TypeScript. This application leverages **Shamir’s Secret Sharing** and the **ElGamal Cryptosystem** to ensure voter anonymity and data integrity. SSL certificates are utilized for vote verification, key management, and user authentication, ensuring end-to-end encryption and trust throughout the voting process.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Voting**: Implements Shamir’s Secret Sharing and ElGamal Cryptosystem to maintain voter anonymity.
- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes SSL certificates for encrypted data transmission.
- **User Authentication**: Ensures only authorized users can participate in the voting process.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Maintains the integrity and confidentiality of votes from casting to counting.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized codebase with clear separation of concerns for scalability and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.1.15 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohamsitapara/E-Voting-System.git
   cd E-Voting-System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Using Bun:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   - Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Update the `.env` file with your specific configuration:

     ```env
     PORT=3000
     SSL_KEY_PATH=./certs/key.pem
     SSL_CERT_PATH=./certs/cert.pem
     ```

4. **Generate SSL Certificates**

   If you don't have SSL certificates, generate self-signed certificates for development:

   ```bash
   mkdir certs
   openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem
   ```

   Follow the prompts to complete the certificate generation.

---

## 🚀 Running the Application

Start the server using Bun:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

The application will be accessible at `https://localhost:3000`.

---

## 🧪 Testing the Application

1. **Access the Application**

   Navigate to `https://localhost:3000` in your web browser. If using self-signed certificates, you may need to bypass security warnings.

2. **User Registration**

   - Register as a new voter by providing the required details.
   - Ensure that the registration process completes successfully.

3. **Casting a Vote**

   - Log in with your registered credentials.
   - Navigate to the voting section and cast your vote.
   - Confirm that the vote is recorded and encrypted appropriately.

4. **Admin Panel**

   - Access the admin panel to view aggregated voting results.
   - Verify that individual votes remain anonymous and that the results are accurately tallied.
