# 🗳️ E-Voting System

A secure, privacy-preserving remote voting system built with Node.js and TypeScript. This application leverages **Shamir’s Secret Sharing** and the **ElGamal Cryptosystem** to ensure voter anonymity and data integrity. SSL certificates are utilized for vote verification, key management, and user authentication, ensuring end-to-end encryption and trust throughout the voting process.

## 🚀 Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Voting**: Implements Shamir’s Secret Sharing and ElGamal Cryptosystem to maintain voter anonymity.
- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes SSL certificates for encrypted data transmission.
- **User Authentication**: Ensures only authorized users can participate in the voting process.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Maintains the integrity and confidentiality of votes from casting to counting.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized codebase with clear separation of concerns for scalability and maintainability.

## 🔐 Security Overview

- **Shamir’s Secret Sharig:** Distributes the decryption key among multiple parties, ensuring that no single entity can decrypt votes independntly.
- **ElGamal Cryptosystm:** Provides homomorphic encryption, allowing for secure vote tallying without decrypting individual otes.
- **SSL Certificats:** Ensure secure communication between clients and the server, preventing man-in-the-middle atacks.

## 🧪 Testing the Application

1. **Access the Application**

   Navigate to `https://localhost:3000` in your web browser. If using self-signed certificates, you may need to bypass security warnings.

2. **User Registration**

   - Register as a new voter by providing the required details.
   - Ensure that the registration process completes successfully.

3. **Casting a Vote**

   - Log in with your registered credentials.
   - Navigate to the voting section and cast your vote.
   - Confirm that the vote is recorded and encrypted appropriately.

4. **Admin Panel**

   - Access the admin panel to view aggregated voting results.
   - Verify that individual votes remain anonymous and that the results are accurately tallied.
